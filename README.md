# AMR_1
<p>This is fully autonomous stack of a differential drive bot, which is used to carry loads. I made the cad model in fusion 360, i used fusion urdf exporter to convert it into urdf. This makes sure of the inertial components are corectly calculated which otherwise would lead to unwanted behaviour</p>

<p>After localization, a action script or gui interface of rviz can be used to give goal or do specific tasks</p>
