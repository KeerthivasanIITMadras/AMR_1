# AMR_1
This is fully autonomous stack of a differential drive bot, which is used to carry loads. I made the cad model in fusion 360, i used fusion urdf exporter to convert it into urdf. This makes sure of the inertial components are corectly calculated which otherwise would lead to unwanted behaviour
